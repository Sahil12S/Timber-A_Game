#Game Planning
##How game will work
1. Time is always running out.  
2. Player earn time by chopping the tree.  
3. Branches fall when tree is chopped.  
4. Faster the tree is chopped, more time will the player earn and faster the branches fall.  
5. Player dies when time runs out or is squished by falling branches.  
6. Score increases on chopping tree.  

##Assets

2. Sound effects for various events like, chopping, dying, falling branches, critical time, background noise.  
3. Graphics for game objects like, character, tree, branches, axe etc.
